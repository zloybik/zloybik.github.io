            You should know before my eventual death.<br><br>

            If you think you're weak. I'm not. The human organism must evolve like other organisms. You just have to do what needs to be done. But if you don't like it, then don't do it.<br><br> 
            
            But you have to understand. If it helps you, you have to do it.<br><br>
            
            I personally don't care about my “possible” death.<br><br>
            
            But I do care about you. You're like a script. Must be developed by a developer.<br><br>
            
            But in this case, the developer is you.<br><br>
            
            Also, please don't just start a war. It's not the right thing to do.<br>
            CS:R and ClassicCounter can be counted as just starting a war.<br><br>
            
            Otherwise, just know that you are NOT a mediocrity.<br>
            Just get rid of the bad habits.<br><br>

            Know that what keeps you going is always there for you.<br>
            And that “what” is at least you.
